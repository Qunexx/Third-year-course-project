Description of task:  
Develop a system to track intraoffice expenses.
Employees of the company have the opportunity to make small purchases for the needs of the company by providing a sales receipt to the accounting department. 
Your company consists of departments. Each department has a name. Each department has a certain number of employees. Employees can make purchases according to expense types. 
Each type of expense has a name, some description and a limit on the amount of funds that can be spent on this type of expense per month. 
For each purchase, the employee draws up a document indicating the type of expense, date, amount and department. 
Standards for spending funds are not set as a whole, but for each department for each month.
